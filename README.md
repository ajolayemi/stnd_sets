A project written for the company am currently working at (Rete InCampagna). 
The company commercializes citrus fruits, vegetables and so on in Italy and beyond. 
It's purpose is to help in automatically generating contents of some products we call
STANDARD SETS. STND_SETS (acronym for STANDARD SETS) are those products that are made up of several other products. 
For example, a box that is made up of 2 kg of Lemon, Orange and maybe Avocado. 
Upon running app.py, a GUI built with PyQt5 will pop up and it is through this GUI that user will be communicating with the
program.
